Using this tutorial: https://www.learnopencv.com/average-face-opencv-c-python-tutorial/ me and my friend Julio (github.com/JCGCosta) manage to make a average face of ours.

Was hard and challeging get used to dlib, not much tutorial on this part, but when we did it was fun to see the dlib landmarking every image of a face we trow at it. 
For some reason the whole program just worked in Windows using a virtual dev enviroment, everything runs in Linux but it never shows the image, it only worked using by 
default images from the "presidents" folder.
